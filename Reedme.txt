To create a level you need to:

1) In the game folder go to '\Niveau

2) Create a '.txt' file named "Niveau-X" where X is the integer following the highest existing one

3) Then you can create the items you want in the level:

3.1) The ball:
- At least one is needed for the game to work, and only the first line containing a ball will be used
- To make a ball you need to write this line:
  'b x y', where (x,y) is the initial position of the ball;
   x should be between 0 (left) and 800 (right),
   y should be between 0 (bottom) and 1000 (top)

3.2) The ropes:
- No minimal amount
- No maximum; however we recommend to limit yourself to (5 max)
- To make a rope you need to write this line:
  'c x y l', where (x,y) is the center point, and l the length of the rope in multiples of 10 pixels
   x should be between 0 (left) and 800 (right),
   y should be between 0 (bottom) and 1000 (top),
   l should be at least 1 (we recommend not to go over 40, more does not fit the screen)

3.3) The spikes:
- No minimal amount
- No maximum; however we recommend to limit yourself to (5 max)
- To make a rope you need to write this line:
  'p x y dir l', where (x,y) is the center point, dir the direction (horizontal or vertical) and l the length of the spikes in multiples of 10 pixels
   x should be between 0 (left) and 800 (right),
   y should be between 0 (bottom) and 1000 (top),
   dir is 0 (horizontal) or 1 (vertical)
   l should be at least 1 (we recommend not to go over 80, more does not fit the screen)

4) When you finished creating your level change the extension of the file to '.niv'
